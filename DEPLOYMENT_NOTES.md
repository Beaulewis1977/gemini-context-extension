### What Was Done

#### 1. Full Model Support ‚úÖ
Added comprehensive support for all current Gemini models:

**Gemini 2.5 Series (Latest 2025 Models):**
- **gemini-2.5-pro**: Most capable for complex reasoning and coding
  - Input: $1.25/M (‚â§200k tokens), $2.50/M (>200k tokens)
  - Output: $10/M (‚â§200k tokens), $15/M (>200k tokens)
  - Context: 1M tokens
  
- **gemini-2.5-flash**: Balanced speed and performance
  - Input: $0.30/M
  - Output: $2.50/M
  - Context: 1M tokens
  
- **gemini-2.5-flash-lite**: Most cost-effective
  - Input: $0.10/M
  - Output: $0.40/M
  - Context: 1M tokens

**Other Models:**
- gemini-2.0-flash-exp
- gemini-1.5-pro (2M context window)
- gemini-1.5-flash

#### 2. Model Comparison Features ‚úÖ
Implemented comprehensive comparison tool (`compare_gemini_models`):
- Displays all models with descriptions and capabilities
- Shows pricing for input/output tokens
- Calculates cost estimates for current usage
- Sorts models by cost efficiency (cheapest first)
- Provides complete model information

#### 3. Enhanced Cost Estimator ‚úÖ
Updated `estimate_api_cost` tool with:
- Latest 2025 pricing data for all models
- Tiered pricing support (models with different rates for small vs large prompts)
- Comprehensive savings analysis showing cost differences between models
- Smart recommendations for cost optimization
- Per-request and total cost breakdowns

#### 4. Updated Context Tracker ‚úÖ
Enhanced `track_context_usage` tool with:
- Support for all models with accurate context window sizes
- Model parameter to analyze any Gemini model
- Model-specific insights (1M vs 2M token windows)
- Enhanced recommendations based on model capabilities

#### 5. Documentation Updates ‚úÖ
- Updated README.md with complete model information
- Updated GEMINI.md with usage examples for all tools
- Added pricing details for all supported models
- Added best practices for model selection

#### 6. Git Repository Setup ‚úÖ
- Initialized git repository
- Set up remote: https://github.com/Beaulewis1977/gemini-context-extension.git
- Committed all changes with comprehensive commit messages
- Successfully pushed to GitHub main branch

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Action Required: GitHub Actions Workflow

Due to GitHub App permissions, the CI/CD workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) could not be pushed automatically. You'll need to add it manually.

### Steps to Add the CI/CD Workflow:

1. **Navigate to your repository on GitHub:**
   https://github.com/Beaulewis1977/gemini-context-extension

2. **Create the workflow file manually:**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab
   - Click "New workflow" or "set up a workflow yourself"
   - Or simply create the file `.github/workflows/ci.yml` through the web interface

3. **Copy the workflow content:**
   The workflow file is located locally at: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   
   Content:
   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on:
     push:
       branches: [main, develop]
     pull_request:
       branches: [main, develop]

   jobs:
     lint-and-build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       strategy:
         matrix:
           node-version: [18.x, 20.x]

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v4

         - name: Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
           uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with:
             node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
             cache: 'npm'

         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm ci

         - name: Run ESLint
           run: npm run lint

         - name: Check Prettier formatting
           run: npm run format:check

         - name: Build TypeScript
           run: npm run build

         - name: Check build output
           run: |
             if [ ! -f dist/server.js ]; then
               echo "Build failed: dist/server.js not found"
               exit 1
             fi
             echo "Build successful!"
   ```

4. **Commit the workflow file directly on GitHub**

This workflow will automatically:
- Run on every push to main/develop branches
- Test against Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- Run ESLint checks
- Verify Prettier formatting
- Build the TypeScript code
- Verify the build output
