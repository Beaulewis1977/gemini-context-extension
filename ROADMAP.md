**Solution**: Comprehensive analytics for all Gemini CLI sessions.

**Features**:
- Session duration and token usage trends
- Cost analysis over time
- Most used tools and commands
- Context usage patterns
- Model switching analysis
- Export to CSV/JSON for external analysis

**Technical Approach**:
- Store session metadata in `.gemini/analytics/`
- Aggregate statistics across sessions
- Generate visual reports (ASCII art charts in terminal)
- Configurable retention policies

**Estimated Complexity**: Medium  
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks

---

### Advanced Memory Manager

**Problem**: Basic `/memory` commands are limited; no smart organization or archiving.

**Solution**: Enhanced memory management with intelligent organization.

**Features**:
- Smart memory categorization (by topic, project, date)
- Memory search and filtering
- Automatic archiving of old memories
- Memory compression for token efficiency
- Memory templates and presets
- Cross-project memory sharing

**Estimated Complexity**: High  
**Time Estimate**: 4-5 weeks

---

## Version 4.0 - Workflow Automation (Planned: 2027)

### Workflow Automation Builder

**Problem**: Complex multi-step workflows require manual orchestration.

**Solution**: Visual workflow builder with automation capabilities.

**Features**:
- Define multi-step workflows (e.g., "code review + test generation + documentation")
- Conditional logic and branching
- Loop constructs for batch processing
- Error handling and retries
- Workflow templates and sharing
- Scheduled execution

**Technical Approach**:
- JSON-based workflow definitions
- State machine execution engine
- Integration with Gemini tools and MCP servers
- Workflow visualization in terminal

**Estimated Complexity**: Very High  
**Time Estimate**: 8-10 weeks

---

### Output Post-Processor

**Problem**: Need to transform model outputs into different formats consistently.

**Solution**: Configurable output transformation pipeline.

**Features**:
- Format conversion (JSON, YAML, CSV, Markdown)
- Text transformations (case conversion, formatting)
- Code formatting and linting
- Custom transformation scripts
- Validation and schema enforcement
- Output templates

**Estimated Complexity**: Medium  
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks

## Principles Guiding Development

1. **Minimal Code**: Every feature should be implemented with the fewest lines possible
2. **Zero Runtime Dependencies**: Use Node.js built-ins whenever possible
3. **Cross-Platform**: All features must work on WSL, Windows, macOS
4. **Performance First**: Tools should be fast and non-blocking
5. **User-Centric**: Solve real problems with simple, intuitive interfaces
